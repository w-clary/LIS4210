About the project:
Visualizing Trends in U.S. County Level Crime Rates (2002-2014)
My colleagues Canace Finley, Naa Adoley Acquaye, and I conducted a comprehensive data analysis of U.S. county-level crime rates from 2002-2014 using data from the National Neighborhood Data Archive. We created interactive visualizations including animated crime rate maps, heatmaps, and comparative analyses of violent and property crimes across states. Our findings revealed significant nationwide decreases in both violent crimes (-27.1%) and property crimes (-30.4%) during this period, with substantial state-by-state variations and California consistently showing the highest crime totals among all states.

About the course:
LIS 4210 Data Visualization in the University of Denver Morgridge College of Education's Library and Information Science Graduate Program provides a practical introduction to the principles, theories, and applications of data visualization in the research data context. This course contextualizes modern practices in information  visualization by examining historical approaches to visualization with an eye on theories that inform contemporary visualization best practices. Using a hands-on component, students get real-world  experience in visualizing datasets, and building visualization dashboards that integrate multiple artifacts.
